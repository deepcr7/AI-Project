This proejct implements a live webpage which predicts whether the person in its feed is currently wearing a mask or not, and it does so after fixed time intervals.
The MobilenEt model has been used as a pretrained one over which KNN classiifer is trained and then the test images live from the video feed as classified.
The border respectively changes colour with green and red for mask and not wearing a mask respectively.
